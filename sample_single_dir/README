It's a sample of Single directory project.
Before compile, fruit.f90, fruit_util.f90, and rake_base.rb must
be copied to this directory.
Fruit_processor generates fruit_driver and fruit_basket and builds driver executable. 

1. Make an empty directory somewhere.
   To the directry, copy
     rake_base.rb
     src/fruit.f90
     src/fruit_util.f90
     sample_single_dir/rakefile
     rake_estimate.rb (experimental)
 from FRUIT tarball or zipball.


2. Let's assume you have written a test code
     mystack_test.f95
  and skelton codes
     Z_constants.f95
     mystack.f95  (without detailed implementation).

  As mystack.f95 depends on Z_constants.f95,
  you'll write this dependency at the end of rakefile.


3. On shell, do

  rake

  It will generate fruit_basket_gen.f90 and fruit_driver_gen.f90, and
  builds fruit_driver_fxx.exe.
  This test driver will be run there.

Then we can start modifying the codes (in this sample mystack.f95 and Z_constants.f95) and run test again.
In rakefile, you have to either load "rake_estimate.rb" or
give dependencies between mystack.o and Z_constants.o.
In the former way, directry may contain extra main program, 
for example "dummy_main.f90". It will be ignored when building fruit_driver.
