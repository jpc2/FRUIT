This sample demonstrates that
fruit_basket_gen.f90 calls only specifiled testers (*_test.f90).

While there are two tester files
  constant_test.f90 and 
  mydict_test.f90,
only the latter is specified in rakefile as

  fp.process_only = FileList["mydict_test.f90"]

Then fruit_processor scans only the specified file and
resulting fruit_basket_gen.f90 and fruit_driver_selective
calls only testers in mydict_test.f90.

By the way, dummy_main.f90 is here just to show
it does not conflict with fruit_driver_gen.f90 while compiling.
If you want to compile dummy_main.f90,

  gfortran constants.f90 mydict.f90 dummy_main.f90

will work.
